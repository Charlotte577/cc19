		1.What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing communication methods for limited audiences? This can address the use, misuse, or lack of use of written language, technology, or visual design as forms of communication.

	<p>

    In the article Octavia Butler and Samuel Delany at MIT, 1998, they talk about the people in 1998 don’t have chance to go to school or learn reading and language. Butler’s mother was taken out of school and put to work when she was very young. Therefore she ended up being hard to read and write. I would say that situation would happen to a lot of people in 1998. Reading and writing seem to be a big part, and a rare thing for most of the people. The development of communication methods develop can be either benefit for people or distract people for reading and writing. In my point of view, the advantages of developing communication methods make people’s life more convenient. People can learn and receive information through the different type of methods. It can be more comprehensive and abundance. In contrast, the disadvantages of developing communication methods are people might rely too much on software and internet. The ability of reading and writing might decrease throughout time. Moreover, people will think that reading and writing are not necessary for the future.
The music and movies on the internet are very attacking, but there are also many interesting things in the text. I agree with Delany’s opine. Even though I enjoy watching tv and listening to music through the internet, but seeing the image and sound online will fix my mind. However, if I know a story by reading the text, I will create my imagination on it. That’s very unique to me. Phil mentions that in the computer entertainment industry, literacy has vanished. However, they are also very literate, they are not unable to read but don’t want to read. Phil suggests that maybe society doesn't need that many people who want to read and write, it also purchases people who don’t want that kind of experience. But I still think it will benefit the world if there are more people can read and write. It is the truth that technology is developing so fast, but we can’t lose our ability to read and write. One of the reasons that making progress in human civilization is people start to record. We learn experience from the past and develop them. I think we should let the ability disappear.

2. As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years?

</h4>
<p>

In recent years, there are more and more people prefer using a computer than paper. We can watch any kind of movie and reading text on the computer. However, when it comes to reading on the paper, some people will read much slower than they usually do. The reason is they get used to reading online, and also make note through typing or using the app to highlight. When they read on paper, they also feel like they are missing something. We are grouping all technology, including video games and online search engines, in the same category, which is a mistake for children. It will be hard for a kid to focus on learning than switch to their favorite TV program. Nowadays, people like to search answer through the internet, and the page will give the exact answer for what they want. We no longer enjoy exploring and finding answer through book and text. However, I believe going through a large number of books for the answer can learn more. On the other hand, it is not to say that being classified as a digital native does not have its benefits in society. Many people today-- those who have access to these technologies--can edit professional-appearing homemade movies on iMovie, improving the quality of their work beyond anything close to being possible a few years ago. There are lots of convenience on the internet. I believe most of the people can not live without the internet. Therefore, I think there are both sides of digital natives, the most important thing is how do we use it.

3. How do you see the expanding or limiting nature of hypertext on today's Web? Do Delany's criticisms of hypertext still hold ture within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements?

</h4>
<p>

I agree with Delany’s criticisms of hypertext. Hypertext does make a less energy-intensive process. Like what Delany mentioned about, we save time and energy by clicking the image on a computer than walk around the gallery. When you get something by using less energy and time, it will very beneficial for our daily life, and that what the hypertext does. However, it also means that it will limit the places you can go to. I also agree what Delany said, “ If you do replace one medium by another medium, you are going to lose something, and, frequently, this is going to be something that’s going to be missed”. There is also some limiting in hypertext, for example, if you find a book in the library, you might find another good book by looking through the shelves. However, if you using hypertext to do so, you probably will miss a good book. I think hypertext still hold within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements. We all need something it is convince and fast sometimes, hypertext is the way of doing that.

4. Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that has come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made? Any that you see as irrelevant?

</h4>
<p>

In the article, they mention that the future of literacy. I disagree that reading is no longer necessary for the majority of the people in the future. Nowadays, people still put a lot of attention in reading and writing, especially for school. Michael Mcafee mentions that “reading and writing itself will be necessary because all our languages developed somehow from the need to put down a permanent symbol for someone who might come along later and have to look at it”. I believe most of the people know and agree with that. We can’t let the literacy disappear, otherwise, we will get back to the old-time, balkanization of language through slang as a way that people use to control the society. We don’t want to back to the very beginning. In the 11 years, all I noticed is that the literacy did not disappear, however, it becomes a necessary part of people’s life.
