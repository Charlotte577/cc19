			By reading the article, I find some interesting points about how to build a website. The author plays audio for the reader, which is an irritating bing-bongs 30 times. I feel so excited by hearing those noises, the feeling of mysterious and unknown. I feel it related to my experience of learning to code. When I first started, I don’t know anything about coding, the feeling of mysterious and unknown kept in my mind. I could think of coding as anything before I started to learn, it could type a few letters and something happened to my computer. Just like what the author said: “Before I began to practice, mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers. After I began to practice, mountains were no longer mountains and rivers were no longer rivers. Now, I have practiced for some time, and mountains are again mountains, and rivers are again rivers.” After I get to know more about coding, I started to realized coding is a brand new thing that is completely different than what I thought before. But after go deeper, I find out it is almost like the same function that I thought before, it is about put the right cod and get the effect that you wanted. It is exactly like what the author said, when you began, “mountains were no longer mountains, rivers were no more rivers.” However, after you go deeper, “mountains are again mountains, and rivers are again rivers.” 
There is also another good point I found in the article. The author mentions about do not fill the page with boxes before you start working on that. Firstly, he uses the example which are the works of artist David Hockney. He is an artist, a painter, and a conflicted photographer. Instead of prints out the photos, as usual, he manages them into separate boxes. Hockney is using redundancy to show action. However, you will not get confused, because your brain stitches the bits together into a complete whole when you look at it. We could see how these edges work by looking at his works. It is the same as creating a website, we always using boxes or a grid to manage how is the page looks like. We like to think first, have a clear picture in our mind before creating the page. But after reading the article, the author encourages us to do it without the boxes. Therefore, we will have more creativity for the layout design. He gives an example by Kasper Laigaard, It is a perfect example of not drawing the box until you know what goes in it. He is creating assemblages of elements, then associating them with the appropriate space. We can explore more when we design in that way, maybe there will be some unexpected things happens during the design process. 
Overall, this article helps me to rethink about web design, and how to use the correct way to create a good web page.
