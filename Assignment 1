			 	<p>The first site that I find interested in is “I Stand Between”. When I first opened the page, I was attracted by the animation of these postcards. I can feel the personal emotion through looking at the photos and words on the page. I think it is a very good idea to add some animation at the very beginning of your first page. It will attract people’s attention. When I slide down, I can see different people’s biography. The web page has a very clear and clean design, I will not get confused when I go through this website. The organization pops up its purpose. I also like how they interact with the background music, and each people have their photos, music, and sign for theirself. what’s more, the information on the last page is also really helpful. Therefore, the site is not only about sharing the stories of these kids, but also collect stories from those who have the same experiences and share it to the public.</p>

             	The second website that I going to talk about is a meditation webpage, called “open this window”. I like the background music on this web page, it gives the feeling of relaxing and clam. I feel like I am in a garden and there are thousands of birds around me when I am listening to the music. This effect helps with the idea of meditation. It also matches with the visual design of the web page. Even though the image is blurry, but this is a good way to leave a space for the reader to do some imagination. However, there are two things I don't like about. First of all, there is no title for this website. I will get confused about what is the purpose of this webpage. Second, the image is a little bit hard to move, and front image stops when I drag it to the left. The image seems to be able to drag both sides, but I am still confused about the direction and what it is used for. Maybe it will be better if add an actual window to the page.</p>

             	<p>
              	“The invisible walls of occupation” is my favorite website among these three sites. The 3D effect in the background attracts my attention. The image is moving while I dragging my mouse. After I click to the "enter", it shows some different section of information about this village. I like the organization so much, it is very clear and it play with the pace, therefore it will not look boring. The music effect is also very beautiful, it makes me feel like I am in a church. The music gives us some imagination and feeling about this little village, and it intrigued me to know more about this place. When I click into the girl’s high school page, I am shocked by how well the 3D effect is been made. It looks like a movie, and the transition of the text and video goes so well in the page. Moreover, these tags on the right top are really helpful for people to insight the village deeper. All the important locations and the roads are all marked on the webpage. It is very easy for people to find information while they are reviewing the website.</p>
