1.Adding to the article, why do you see value in nonlinear narratives? When do you think they are more appropriate than linear narratives?

</p>
</em>
		<p>
			The value for nonlinear narratives is that they donâ€™t have a fix story lines, if the customer is using the web page, he can switch or change into other links , hop from branch to branch via contextual links, scrolling, or an index quickly. However, all of the separate parts are link to the main topic. The images, videos, texts, sounds and so on. The most important part for nonlinear narratives is that people can jumping from one piece of information to the next. I think the nonlinear narratives is much better than the linear narratives, for example, if the customer wants to buy a product, and he saw the image on the website. He can simply click on it instead of go down to the bottom of the page and find it. It is more connivance than the linear narratives, and it also save a lot of time.

2.How does the history of hypertext/hypermedia discussed at the beginning of this semester connect to the concepts and projects discussed in this article?


</p>
</em>
		<p>

The aim for hypermedia or hypertext is to make the world more connivance. In this article, the nonlinear narratives is also doing the same thing as hypertext. The nonlinear narratives can let you jump to another page easily, and for hypermedia it can let people know more about the world by using internet.
